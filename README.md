# Amazon Warehouse Adventure

A text adventure game set in a working Amazon warehouse where the robots probably unionized last week.

## What is this?

Legend says it's a game where you do riveting tasks like sorting packages, interrogating guard robots, and using a screwdriver on a broken shipping bot. Or maybe it's all in your mind.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x (if you can figure out how to install it).
- A sense of humor/sanity. You'll need both.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo. Or don't bother.
2. Run `pip install -r requirements.txt` if you find a requirements file. Good luck.
3. See step 1.

## Usage

```bash
python3 amazon_warehouse_adventure.py
```

Type commands. Or stare blankly at the prompt until the game feels bad enough to start.

## How to win

- Find the maintenance code (472). Use an access card. Or maybe hack the guard.
- Fix the robot. Or bribe it with oil.
- Escape. Or eat lunch there forever.

## Tips

- If you're stuck, read the code. But who has time for that?
- Try banging on things. It's not guaranteed to work.

## Support

If you need help, ask a real programmer. This README won't help.
